# Truck Fuel Efficiency Prediction
This GitHub project is dedicated to predicting fuel efficiency in trucks using real-world data by measuring throttle inputs. Efficient fuel consumption is critical for both cost savings and reducing the environmental footprint of trucking operations. By leveraging real-world data and throttle measurements, we aim to create a valuable tool for optimizing fuel usage and minimizing carbon emissions.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that can estimate fuel efficiency based on throttle inputs. By analyzing the relationship between throttle usage and fuel consumption, we aim to provide trucking companies and drivers with actionable insights to enhance their operations.

## Key Features and Components
### Data Preprocessing: 
Comprehensive data preprocessing routines are included to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
### Model Development: 
This project offers a variety of machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques for building predictive models that estimate fuel efficiency.
### Throttle-Related Insights: 
We analyze the impact of throttle inputs on fuel efficiency and provide visualizations and insights to help users understand the relationship.
### Model Evaluation: 
Robust evaluation metrics are provided to assess the performance of the predictive models, allowing users to choose the best model for their specific needs.
### Real-World Application: 
We demonstrate how the trained models can be applied in real-world scenarios to make informed decisions about optimizing fuel efficiency.
